This app is written in Vanilla JS and does not use a frontend framework like React or Svelte. There are no runtime dependencies. Since Cloud Phone uses a modern Chromium engine, there is no transpilation to support older browsers.

## Features

This app was designed to be as simple as possible to use, while illustrating what you can build on Cloud Phone. Several important features make this possible:

- Converts currencies live as you type
- ~~Default currency prediction~~
- Remembers and stores currency selection in `localStorage`
- Rounds to commonly available denominations
- Displays currency symbols, codes, and country flags

## Exchange Rate Data

Currency conversion rates are sourced from [`fawazahmed0/currency-api`](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api/), hosted on CDNs including JSDelivr and Cloudflare Pages. The latest exchange rates are used with USD as a base currency.

### Other Data

The following data set was generated by ChatGPT:

* [`src/data/currencies.json`](src/data/currencies.json) - a list of currency information including codes, names, symbols, and denominations.

## :wrench: Components

This app is designed to be as simple as possible, and to work on both QVGA (240x320) and QQVGA (160x128) screens by users predominantly in South Asia. It includes several components:

* [`src/components/header.ts`](src/header.ts) - a header displaying a title
* [`src/components/softkeys.ts`](src/softkeys.ts) - a navigation bar fixed at the bottom of the screen with three actions: left, right, and center
* [`src/components/currencyInput.ts`](src/currencyInput.ts) - a partially AI-generated Web Component to simplify typing currencies on T9 Cloud Phone devices
* [`src/components/currencyList.ts`](src/currencyList.ts) - a list for selecting currencies

## Cloud Phone Details

This app mainly uses web standards and works outside of Cloud Phone, but requires one feature specific to Cloud Phone.

### `x-puffin-entersfullscreen`

The `x-puffin-entersfullscreen="off"` attribute is set in [`src/currencyInput.ts`](src/currencyInput.ts). By default, pressing `Enter` on an `<input>` element in Cloud Phone will open a native UI for text entry. The native UI is helpful for T9 predictive text and autocorrect, but its unnecessary for basic numeric input. Instead, the app directly intercepts the `keydown` event, moves the cursor using arrow keys, and renders the number as a formatted currency.

## Commands

This app uses `rsbuild` to compile and bundle, and `terser` to minify, the application into a single JavaScript file.

Watch, build, and serve on a local server

npm run-script dev
```
